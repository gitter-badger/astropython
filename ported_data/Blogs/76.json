While techniques for doing this efficiently have\nevolved, only few scientists actually use them. As a result, instead\nof doing their research, they spend far too much time writing\ndeficient code and reinventing the wheel. In this course we will\npresent a selection of advanced programming techniques with\ntheoretical lectures and practical exercises tailored to the needs\nof a programming scientist. New skills will be tested in a real\nprogramming project: we will team up to develop an entertaining\nscientific computer game.\n\nDate & Location\n\n\nFebruary 8th \u2014 12th, 2010. Warsaw, Poland.
