These originated in the Starlink project and Mark Taylor continues to develop and innovate them with a recent example being an significant expansion of their capabilities to access online (virtual) astronomical resources. Mark has developed a Jython interface to STILTS, which he has issued as a pre-release for testing purposes.\u00a0 Jython (currently at v2.5) is a pure Java Python implementation that contains most of the core Python capabilities.\u00a0 We are soliciting feedback on astropython.org for JySTILTS in order to see this excellent tool set continue to improve.Links:TOPCAT Mailing List and JySTILTS PostPre-Release Source Code (ftp)", "tags": ["news", "test", "jython", "vo"], "title": "Testing a Jython Table Toolkit: JySTILTS"}
