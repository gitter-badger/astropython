It's a python-based N-body/SPH analysis framework meant to simplify analysis by providing an intuitive interface for some of the most common tasks. We're gearing up for a first public release in a few months, but the code is very much useable already so we would welcome brave beta-testers. It works transparently with gasoline/pkdgrav/tipsy as well as gadget outputs. We're ironing out some tedious kinks with regards to installation etc. so we're very much interested in any sort of feedback regarding those issues. Have a look at the google code page and let us know what you think!", "tags": ["modeling"], "title": "N-body SPH analysis with Python"}
