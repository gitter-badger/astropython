If during these five years you have appreciated our work,\u00a0and wish to support us for a last attempt to raise funds, you may\u00a0want to subscribe our petition at this web pagehttp://cosmos.iasf-milano.inaf.it/pandora/petition.htmlThe PANDORA group\"SAMPy in particular is pretty critical to the integration of python with other VO software tools and one can hope that another astropython effort will pick up support for it soon.", "tags": ["new", "vo"], "title": "Losing the PANDORA Software group"}
