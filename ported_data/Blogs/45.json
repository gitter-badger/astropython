How do I go about this?For instance, Ben Weiner commented on a blog post here\u00a0http://www.astrobetter.com/spectral-line-analysis-tools/#comment-3349\u00a0and I basically want to know how to do that in python.Thanks!", "tags": ["fitting", "spectra"], "title": "[Question] How to measure spectral line equivalent widths"}
