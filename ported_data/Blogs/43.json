This library has the primary task of importing (into python) the XML files used in the virtual observatory to deliver structured data.\u00a0 An extension to this library is a tool to query remote astronomy databases, having the data and metadata returned into your python session.\u00a0 There is also a \"shell\" for running these remote table queries with the nice feature that it can connect to other VO software like TOPCAT (using the unpleasant sounding acronym SAMP). This screencast is an excellent quick look into how to use this shell, which also helps you to understand why these tools are being written.\u00a0 Some additional libraries are available for especially complex issues structured data in astronomy.", "tags": ["vo"], "title": "Querying tables in the virtual observatory"}
