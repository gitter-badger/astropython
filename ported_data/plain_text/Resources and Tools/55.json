Intended as a modern-language successor to the\nIRAF/STSDAS synphot package, it provides improved algorithms that\naddress known shortcomings in synphot, and its object-oriented design\nis more easily extensible than synphot's task-oriented approach. It will run under PyRAF, and a backwards\ncompatibility mode is provided that will recognize all spectral and\nthroughput tables, obsmodes, and spectral expressions used by synphot,\nto facilitate the transition for legacy code.\nRead pysynphot documentation.pysynphot is part of the Astrolib repository.", "tags": ["astrolib", "photometry"], "title": "pysynphot"}
