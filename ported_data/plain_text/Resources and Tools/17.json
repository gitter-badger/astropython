Reionization is a particular focus. See\nbelow for a longer list of capabilities.\n\n\nFunctions take cosmological parameters (which can be numpy arrays)\nas keywords, and ignore any extra keywords. This means you can make a\ndictionary of all of your cosmological parameters and pass it to any\nfunction.\n\nExample\n\nCalculate the comoving distance to redshift 6.\n>>> import cosmolopy.distance as cd>>> cosmo = {'omega_M_0':0.3, 'omega_lambda_0':0.7, 'omega_k_0':0.0, 'h':0.72}>>> d_co, err = cd.comoving_distance(6., **cosmo)>>> print \"Comoving distance to z=6 is %.1f Mpc\" % (d_co)Comoving distance to z=6 is 8017.8 Mpc\n\nLook\nin tests/\nand examples/\nfor more examples.\n\n\nCapabilities\nSee the API\ndocs for a full listing.\ncosmolopy.reionizationRoutines related to the reionization of the IGM.cosmolopy.distanceCalculate various cosmological distance measures.cosmolopy.luminosityfunctionRoutines related to galaxy luminosity functions (Schechter\n  functions).cosmolopy.perturbationRoutines related to perturbation theory and the power\n  spectrum.", "tags": ["cosmology"], "title": "CosmoloPy"}
