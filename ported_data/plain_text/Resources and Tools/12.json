A table is defined by any number\nof columns of data, each characterized by a column name, unit, null\nvalue, and description (the last three being optional), and can be\nsupplemented with metadata in the form of keywords or comments. ATpy\ncan be used to manipulate single tables as well as sets of tables.ATpy can be used to:\n\nSeamlessly read and write table data to a number of table\nformats (FITS, VO, HDF5, IPAC, and arbitrary ASCII tables, and\nSQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL databases), building on existing Python modules. More formats will be supported in future.\nRemove, add, or rename columns.\nAccess and modify individual table cells.\nCreate an empty table and populate it.\nCreate a new table from a selection of rows.\nAdd keywords and comments.\nRead and write sets of tables.", "tags": ["FITS", "votable", "IPAC", "SQL", "tables"], "title": "ATpy"}
