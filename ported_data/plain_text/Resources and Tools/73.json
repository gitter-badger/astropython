It builds on the capabilities of the \n    well-known NumPy and MatPlotLib packages. Publication quality output direct from analyses \n    is emphasized among other goals:\n    \n   Quickly obtain data\nCreate publications quality plots\nPerform complicated analysis easily\nRun common empirical models\nChange coordinates effortlessly\nHarness the power of Python\n\nThe SpacePy project seeks to promote accurate and open research standards by \n    providing an open environment for code development. In the space physics community there \n    has long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free transfer \n    of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive, open-source library \n    of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and intuitive language, \n    we hope that this reliance will be diminished.", "tags": ["coordinates", "images", "time"], "title": "SpacePy"}
