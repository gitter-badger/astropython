TVTK\nmanipulates visualization objects, while Mayavi2 lets you operate on\nyour data, and then see the results. Most users either use the Mayavi\nuser interface or program to its scripting interface; you probably\ndon't need to interact with TVTK unless you want to create a new Mayavi\nmodule.", "tags": ["plotting"], "title": "Mayavi"}
