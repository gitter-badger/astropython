For typical thermal models this would\ninclude the radial temperature and density profiles. This basic method\nhas been used extensively for X-ray cluster analysis and is the basis for the\nXSPEC model projct. The deproject module brings this\nfunctionality to Sherpa as a Python module that is straightforward to use and\nunderstand.\nThe deproject module uses specstack to allow for manipulation of\na stack of related input datasets and their models. Most of the functions\nresemble ordinary Sherpa commands (e.g. set_par, set_source, ignore)\nbut operate on a stack of spectra.\nThe basic physical assumption of deproject is that the extended source\nemissivity is constant and optically thin within spherical shells whose radii\ncorrespond to the annuli used to extract the specta. Given this assumption one\nconstructs a model for each annular spectrum that is a linear volume-weighted\ncombination of shell models. The geometry is illustrated in the figure below\n(which would be rotated about the line to the observer in three-dimensions):", "tags": ["X-ray", "sherpa", "cluster"], "title": "deproject"}
