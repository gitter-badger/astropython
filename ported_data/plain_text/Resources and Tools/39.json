It implements aflexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer (far-field)diffraction and point spread function formation, particularly inthe context of astronomical telescopes. POPPY was developed aspart of a simulation package for JWST, but is more broadlyapplicable to many kinds of imaging simulations.", "tags": ["JWST", "image"], "title": "POPPY"}
