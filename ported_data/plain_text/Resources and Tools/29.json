(Modules\nwcs and\ncelestial)\nVersatile tools for writing small and dedicated applications for the\ninspection of FITS headers, the extraction and display of (FITS) data,\ninteractive inspection of this data (color editing) and for the creation\nof plots with world coordinate information. (Module\nmaputils)\nAs one example, a\ngallery of all-sky plots\nis provided.\nA class for the efficient reading, writing and\nmanipulating simple table-like structures in text files.\n(Module tabarray)\nUtilities for use with matplotlib such as\nobtaining coordinate information from plots, interactively modifiable\ncolormaps and timer events\n(module mplutil); tools for parsing and\ninterpreting coordinate information entered by the user (module\npositions).", "tags": ["WCS", "coordinates", "FITS", "plotting", "tables", "matplotlib"], "title": "Kapteyn"}
