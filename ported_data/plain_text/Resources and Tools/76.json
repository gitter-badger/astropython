After many revisions, it has generalized into a \nplatform for doing fast spatial statistics on arbitrary spherical \ngeometries using 10s of millions of points. The current version exists \nas a C++ library but the eventual plans include a SWIG-ified python \nwrapper and database back end.\"", "tags": ["coordinates", "astrometry", "tables", "database", "statistics", "answers"], "title": "STOMP"}
