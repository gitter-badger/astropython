But unlike other monolithic table reader implementations,\nasciitable is based on a modular and extensible class structure. Formats\nthat cannot be handled by the existing hooks in the read() function can be\naccomodated by modifying the underlying class methods as needed.\nAsciitable can read a wide range of ASCII table formats via built-in Extension Reader Classes:\nBasic: basic table with customizable delimiters and header configurations\nCds: CDS format table (also Vizier and ApJ machine readable tables)\nCommentedHeader: column names given in a line that begins with the comment character\nDaophot: table from the IRAF DAOphot package\nIpac: IPAC format table\nNoHeader: basic table with no header where columns are auto-named\nRdb: tab-separated values with an extra line after the column definition line\nTab: tab-separated values\n\nAsciitable is part of the Astrolib repository.", "tags": ["tables", "astrolib"], "title": "asciitable"}
