The software:\nmust be useful for astronomy (but we don't rule out general purpose tools that aren't available else where (we'll worry about contributing to scipy or other more general purpose sets when the software proves useful in other fields)\nmust have an open source license (preferably BSD, MIT, LGPL, but we can accept GPL)\nmust be usable from Python\nmay call other languages or even executables that are not part of the repository.\nmay include embedded C, C++, Fortran code called from Python\"\n\nThere are currently 7 active components:asciidata: a Python module to handle (read/modify/write) ASCII tablesasciitable: an extensible ASCII table readerpysynphot: a synthetic photometry software packagecoords: for managing astronomical coordinate systemstfit: for photometry of mixed-resolution data setspywcs: a set of routines for handling the FITS World Coordinate Systemvo: library to parse, validate and generate the VO XML Table format", "tags": ["astrolib", "repository"], "title": "AstroLib"}
