It contains a\npowerful language for combining simple models into complex expressions\nthat can be fit to the data using a variety of statistics and\noptimization methods. It is easily extensible to include user models,\nstatistics and optimization methods.\nWhat can you do with Sherpa?\n\nFit 1D (multiple) data including: spectra, surface brightness\nprofiles, light curves, general ASCII arrays\nFit 2D images/surfaces in Poisson/Gaussian regime\nBuild complex model expressions\nImport and use your own models\nUse appropriate statistics for modeling Poisson or Gaussian data\nImport new statistics, with priors if required by analysis\nVisualize a parameter space with simulations or using 1D/2D cuts of\nthe parameter space\nCalculate confidence levels on the best fit model parameters\nChoose a robust optimization method for the fit: Levenberg-Marquardt,\nNelder-Mead Simplex or Monte Carlo/Differential Evolution.", "tags": ["X-ray", "fitting", "modeling", "sherpa"], "title": "sherpa"}
