I am particularly attached to Basemap for plotting as it, among other things, provides all-sky projections like Mollweide.Here is a crude example (not in moll, sadly):http://web.njit.edu/~gary/321/gal_coord.gifThe two coordinate systems are related by two rotations. I see how to define the latitude to achieve one, but not other.Even if I could define a map with the appropriate tilts to achieve galactic coordinates, I had some trouble drawing a second map's grid lines over another underlying map. \u00a0I tried defining a separate Basemap object with a different lat_0 but the drawparallels command seems to erase any previously drawn maps (hold=False?).Thanks for any insights or solutions anyone might have.\"", "tags": ["questions", "coordinates", "matplotlib", "images"], "title": "[Question] Overplot multiple coordinate systems with Basemap"}
