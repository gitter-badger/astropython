I know that in IDL the Lomb-Scargle periodogram is commonly used, and I am looking for an equivalent function from some package somewhere.I've googled \"Lomb Scargle python\" (noquotes) and found a couple of possibly useful results, but nothing that was included in any of the modules recommended by this website (such as scipy).Do you know of a good way to calculate Lomb-Scargle periodograms for unevenly-sampled data in python?\"\u00a0", "tags": ["questions"], "title": "[Question] period-finding packages in python"}
