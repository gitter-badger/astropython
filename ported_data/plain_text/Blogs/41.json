Two of the talks were related to astronomy.Maciej Fijalkowski, one of the developer of\u00a0PyPy, works at SKA South Africa and he\u00a0talked about\u00a0how SKA South Africa is using Python for the day to day functioning of the KAT7 array at Karroo. The KAT7 array is a prototype for the MeerKAT array, which in turn is a precursor for the SKA.Some of the tasks for which they use Python are:A simulator for the entire telescope system.\nChecking status of telescope instruments.\nChecking weather status.\nPointing the telescope (from an iPython prompt!).\nIntrospect features of an antenna.\n\nAccording to him the system will scale to 1000s of antennas, which is the aim of SKA. The project has already\u00a0released portions of the code base under open source license\u00a0(links at the bottom of this URL).Michael Sims from NASA AMES gave a talk\u00a0on his experience in using Python for designing an automation system for the Mars Exploration Rovers. Among many other roles at NASA, he is a co-investigator on the Mars Exploration Rovers project, and is part of the science team and the operations team for the rovers.The system he designed is called AutoPUL: Auto Payload Uplink Lead. This system was designed to generate a set of \"commands\" for the operations of the on-board cameras, deliver these commands to the rovers, create web pages as reports, and for many other operations. AutoPUL, and other automated components, reduced the time needed for generating these commands from 8-12 hours to about 15 minutes.Based on his experience in building AutoPUL, he mentions the following as the pros and cons of Python:Maintenance has been mostly trivial, with one exception. Bugs were small in number, approximately 1 per year, and gets fixed in an hour or so.\nPython is good at interacting with the operating system.\nhttps (urllib2) processing was problematic.\n\nAccording to him the utility of Python comes from the way it saves programmer's time, the correctness of programs due to the its' simplicity, its' robustness, and facilities for user interactions. He points out that optimization for execution speed is done only when it becomes an issue.He concludes with the following observations:\"Python for me is a tool for creating sculptures of interaction. It is not particularly interesting in and of itself. A sculptor's clay. Overall, I'm amazingly pleased at what I can easily build with Python.\"As a bonus, the video shows a great virtual reality simulation, starting at 24:40!In addition to the two talks, Miguel de Val-Borro\u00a0mentions\u00a0that he has a poster on Herschel data reduction and visualization using Python tools.The full list of talks presented at PyCon 2011 is available at\u00a0this url.
