The emphasis is on using Python to solve real-world problems that astronomers are likely to encounter in research.The workshops immediately make use of the full suite of plotting, analysis, and file reading tools. Along the way elements of the Python language such as data types, control structures, functions, and objects are introduced.\u00a0 This is an interactive experience using tutorial examples run by participants on their laptops.Workshop topics:\nIntroduction and Motivation\nPython Installation and Understanding Packages\nCore packages for analysis: IPython, NumPy, and SciPy\nCONTEST: Make a fun bouncing balls demo\nPlotting and Images\nReading and Writing files\nFitting and Modeling 1-D and 2-D Data\nOnline Astronomy and the virtual observatory", "tags": ["FITS", "environment", "fitting", "idl", "images", "image", "matplotlib", "modeling", "numpy", "plotting", "scipy", "sherpa", "tables", "tutorial", "vo", "votable", "workshops"], "title": "Practical Python for Astronomers"}
