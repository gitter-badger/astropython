It is also the name\nof a very popular <a class=\"http\" href=\"http://conference.scipy.org\">conference</a> on scientific programming with Python. The SciPy library depends on <a class=\"http\" href=\"http://numpy.scipy.org\">NumPy</a>,\nwhich provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation.\nThe SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays, and provides many\nuser-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for\nnumerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all\npopular operating systems, are quick to install, and are free of\ncharge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to be\ndepended upon by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.\nIf you need to manipulate numbers on a computer and display or publish\nthe results, give SciPy a try! <span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-18\"></span><span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-19\"></span></p><p class=\"line867\"><span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-20\"></span></p><p class=\"line867\"><span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-21\"></span><span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-22\"></span><span class=\"anchor\" id=\"line-23\"></span></p><div class=\"line-block\">\n<div class=\"line\"><br/></div>\n</div>\n</div>", "tags": ["scipy", "numpy"], "title": "SciPy"}
