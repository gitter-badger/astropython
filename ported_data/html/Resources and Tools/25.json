It has a very simple command-line interface, and\nconverts all IDL variables to python types. Arrays are converted to\nNumpy arrays, and Structures are converted to Numpy record arrays.<br/><br/>The IDLSave code is now also available in scipy.io.\n        </div>", "tags": ["idl", "scipy"], "title": "IDLSave"}
