It builds on the capabilities of the \n    well-known NumPy and MatPlotLib packages. Publication quality output direct from analyses \n    is emphasized among other goals:\n    \n   <ul type=\"circle\"><li>Quickly obtain data</li>\n<li>Create publications quality plots</li>\n<li>Perform complicated analysis easily</li>\n<li>Run common empirical models</li>\n<li>Change coordinates effortlessly</li>\n<li>Harness the power of Python</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The SpacePy project seeks to promote accurate and open research standards by \n    providing an open environment for code development. In the space physics community there \n    has long been a significant reliance on proprietary languages that restrict free transfer \n    of data and reproducibility of results. By providing a comprehensive, open-source library \n    of widely-used analysis and visualization tools in a free, modern and intuitive language, \n    we hope that this reliance will be diminished.\n\t</p>\n</div>", "tags": ["coordinates", "images", "time"], "title": "SpacePy"}
