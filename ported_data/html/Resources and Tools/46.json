Pyflation has been created by Ian Huston as part of his research activities at Queen Mary, University of London.<br/><br/>It is released under an open source modified BSD license and is available for download. Detailed information about the numerical calculations possible can be found in the related publications.<br/><br/>Once installed the modules in the pyflation Python package can be used to run simulations of different scalar field models of the early universe. The main classes are contained in the cosmomodels module and include simulations of background fields and first order and second order perturbations. The sourceterm package contains modules required for the computation of the term required for the evolution of second order perturbations.<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"border-collapse: separate; color: #000000; font-family: Times; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande','liberation sans',verdana,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-align: left;\"></span></span>\n</div>", "tags": ["cosmology"], "title": "pyflation"}
