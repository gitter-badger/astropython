It implements a<br/>flexible framework for modeling Fraunhofer (far-field)<br/>diffraction and point spread function formation, particularly in<br/>the context of astronomical telescopes. POPPY was developed as<br/>part of a simulation package for JWST, but is more broadly<br/>applicable to many kinds of imaging simulations.<br/>\n</div>", "tags": ["JWST", "image"], "title": "POPPY"}
