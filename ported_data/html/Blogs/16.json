Oct. 2012<br/><br/>Scientists spend an increasing amount of time building and using software. However, most scientists are never taught how to do this efficiently. As a result, many are unaware of tools and practices that would allow them to write more reliable and maintainable code with less effort. We describe a set of best practices for scientific software development that have solid foundations in research and experience, and that improve scientists' productivity and the reliability of their software.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530\" target=\"_blank\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530</a>\n</div>", "tags": ["efficiency"], "title": "Paper on Best Practices for Scientific Computing"}
