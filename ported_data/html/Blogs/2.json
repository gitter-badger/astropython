Effective Computation in Physics is a manual for<br/>starting up or honing your programming and software skills even<br/>though your background is in the physical sciences or<br/>engineering. This book is your field guide to computing and<br/>research in the context of the work that you are already<br/>doing. We cover all of the big topics that you'll need, from how<br/>to program in Python, how to use important Python third party<br/>libraries such as NumPy and Pandas, how to interact with the<br/>command line, how to write quality publications using LaTeX, and<br/>we even dive into the social aspects of science and software<br/>development by teaching you Git and GitHub.<br/><br/>This book is aimed at people from all physics-based fields. We<br/>take this to mean physics, astronomy, astrophysics, geology,<br/>geophysics, climate science, applied math, biophysics, nuclear<br/>engineering, mechanical engineering, material science, electrical<br/>engineering, and more!\"\n        </div>", "tags": ["numpy", "HPC", "distributed"], "title": "Effective Computation in Physics (with Python of course!)"}
