Instead of building and maintaining a\npermanent Beowulf cluster, we can launch a cluster on-demand using\nPython and EC2. This talk will cover the basics involved in getting\nyour own cluster running using Python, demonstrate how to run some\nlarge parallel computations using Python MPI wrappers, and show some\ninitial results on cluster performance.<br/><br/>Slides available at <a dir=\"ltr\" href=\"http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/event/10/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/schedule/event/10/\">http://us.pycon.org/2008/conference/s...</a> </span>\n</div>\n<span class=\"watch-channel-stat\"></span><p></p>\n</div>", "tags": ["MPI", "distributed"], "title": "MPI Cluster Programming with Python and Amazon EC2"}
