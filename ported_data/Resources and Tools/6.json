Moreover the Python language is developing into some kind of standard programming language in astronomy, and being able to handle this major data exchange format in a nice way within it would would be very advantageous.The development of the AstroAsciiData module is taking place as part of the AstroLib project, an open source effort to develop general astronomical utilities akin to those available in the IDL ASTRON package.The prime focus of the module is not computational speed, since the ASCII tables used in astronomy are rather small (<10MB) and thus very easy to handle for modern day computers. The main effort was clearly to maximize the convenience for the user to keep the threshold for installing and using the AstroAsciiData module as low as possible. It is part of the Astrolib repository.", "tags": ["tables", "astrolib"], "title": "AstroAsciiData"}
