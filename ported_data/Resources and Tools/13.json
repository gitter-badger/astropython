CASA is being\n      developed by a collaboration led by NRAO with the primary\n      goal of supporting the data post-processing needs of the\n      next generation of radio astronomical telescopes such as\n      the ALMA and EVLA projects. The CASA tasks are oriented\n      towards end-user data processing and analysis, while the\n      toolkit is geared towards the support of pipeline\n      processing, algorithm development, and the construction of \ntasks.", "tags": ["radio"], "title": "CASA"}
