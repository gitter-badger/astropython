The module uses \n Matplotlib, \n a powerful and interactive \n plotting package. It is capable of creating output files in several graphical \n formats, including EPS, PDF, PS, PNG, and SVG.\n \nMain features\n\nMake plots interactively or using scripts\n \nShow grayscale, colorscale, and 3-color RGB images of FITS files\n \nGenerate co-aligned FITS cubes to make 3-color RGB images\n \nOverlay any number of contour sets\n \nOverlay markers with fully customizable symbols\n \nPlot customizable shapes like circles, ellipses, and rectangles\n \nOverlay coordinate grids\n \nCustomize the appearance of labels and ticks\n \nHide, show, and remove different contour and marker layers\n \nPan, zoom, and save any view as a full publication-quality plot\n \nSave plots as EPS, PDF, PS, PNG, and SVG", "tags": ["plotting", "images", "FITS"], "title": "APLpy"}
