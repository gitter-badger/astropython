This is currently focused on distance measures.\ncoords: Tools for working with astronomical coordinates and coordinate transformations. Used to be called astro_util. There is still an alias for that name available.\nhtm: This is a Class to deal with the Hierarchical Triangular Mesh, which is a method for breaking the unit sphere into a tree structure where each node in the tree is represented by a spherical triangle. A primary advantage of the HTM over other schemes is that it deals perfectly well with the poles. This class contains code for matching ra/dec lists, measuring two-point correlation functions (using the bincount method), and finding node information for ra/dec points.", "tags": ["statistics", "cosmology", "coordinates", "WCS", "astrometry", "numpy"], "title": "esutil"}
