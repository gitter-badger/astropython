Consider using the Python(x,y), ActiveState, or Enthought distributions if you are new to Python or need support.[Editorial note: not too many astronomers use Windows, but if you do you are in luck, this page is amazing!\u00a0 If only there were analogs for Linux and Mac.]", "tags": ["numpy", "scipy", "matplotlib", "packages"], "title": "Windows binaries"}
