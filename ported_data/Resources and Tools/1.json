Homepage URL: http://obswww.unige.ch/~tewes/alipy/Alipy provides a set of python scripts that can be used to align a stack of dithered FITS images.\u00a0\u00a0 The included scripts wrap a number of python modules, pyraf, and s-extractor into a linear workflow that is designed to be run interactively by the user.\u00a0 Currently support appears best tuned for FITS images having the same sky pixel scale and from a similar wavelength regime.\u00a0", "tags": ["astrometry", "pyraf", "FITS", "script"], "title": "alipy"}
