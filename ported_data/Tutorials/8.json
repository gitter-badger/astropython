These learning tasks are enabled by the tools available in the open-source package scikit-learn.This tutorial was presented at the Scipy 2012 conference and is available on video. scikit-learn is a Python module integrating classic machine learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python packages (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib). It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts: machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.", "tags": ["scipy", "statistics", "tutorial"], "title": "Machine Learning for Astronomy with scikit-learn"}
