{"date_published": "2009-12-16", "author": "virtualastronomer", "description": "Taking your first steps into python can be daunting and there are a bewildering number of tutorials available if you start googling.\u00a0 Here we try to single out a few of the best that can get you going and show the basic tools that are available for scientific analysis in python.Python languageOne good (though somewhat unorthodox) online introduction to the Python language itself is Dive Into Python.\u00a0 This includes some very useful explanation of which Python version is the right one for you depending on platform.\u00a0 This is especially relevant if you are working on MacOSX.\u00a0 Just the first three chapters will get you 95% of the way to being able to use python effectively for analysis.A more traditional and very reasonable introduction is the python.org tutorial.Tools overviewFor a quick introduction to the basic tools numpy, scipy, and matplotlib that you'll use for analysis see http://www.scipy.org/Getting_Started.Numerical analysisThe core numerical analysis module for python is numpy and you can get started with http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial.\u00a0 The numpy package is at the bottom of almost everything astronomy related in python.PlottingThere are plenty of 1-d and 2-d plotting packages available within python but the most popular general purpose package is matplotlib.\u00a0 This package is modeled after Matlab and for basic plots is extremely simple to use.\u00a0 A nice tutorial showing the basic features is http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/pyplot_tutorial.html.For making publication quality 2-d image plots of astronomical images you'll want to check out the APLpy quick start guide.Scientific toolsThe scipy module provides the core set of scientific tools and algorithms for analysis.\u00a0 Included within the reference guide is a good tour of some key functionality including numerical integration, interpolation, signal processing, statistics and image processing.\u00a0 See http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/.Astronomy data reductionA tutorial introduction to data analysis and the Python installation is available at the Python for Astronomers site.A bit more hardcore (and slightly dated) but directed exactly to astronomers is the tutorial on using python for interactive data analysis in astronomy.\u00a0 The course web page is http://www.scipy.org/wikis/topical_software/Tutorial.\u00a0 For some reason I can never see the actual tutorial in that web page, but the PDF is at http://stsdas.stsci.edu/perry/pydatatut.pdf.", "tags": ["numpy", "scipy", "matplotlib", "images", "plotting"], "title": "Getting started with python in astronomy"}
